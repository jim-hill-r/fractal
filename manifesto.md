Manifesto for Responsible Computing

- Verifiable source code: Code should be easier for everyone to understand how it works and what it does without knowing the details of the implementation. Zero-trust proofs.
- Defensive code: Responsible patterns are more important than developer experience. Idempotency and immutability are key to safe code by design.
- Typed code: Anything that can be validated deteriministically through whitebox or code analysis should be. Testing should only be needed for dynamic portions of code. Invariants need to be first-class citizens.
- Secretless Computing: Eliminate the need for secrets. Security through design.
- Limited Extensibility: Define specifics of extensibility to eliminate possibilty of bad actors
- Hermetic Execution: There should be no doubt about if run A and run B separated by decades ran exactly the same.
- Efficiency through Simplicity: Everyone is really just re-inventing the wheel. Requiring Google to code is very inefficient. We all have to know like 20 languages, formats, and Operating Systems. How can we unify this so less is more! Let's not add more layers on top of existing. Let's refactor our foundations for efficiency.

The three 'I's of responsiblility by design
- Invariant
- Immutable
- Idempotent

Consequences
- Our jobs get a lot harder!
- So what? Humanity needs to be confident it understands the emerging intelligence we are building and not just letting it emerge due to profit.
